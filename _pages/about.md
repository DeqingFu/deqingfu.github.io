## About 
Iâ€™m a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <span style="color:#990000;">University of Southern California (USC)</span>. My main research interests are deep learning theory, natural language processing, and the interpretability of AI systems. I'm (co-)advised by [Prof. Vatsal Sharan](https://vatsalsharan.github.io) of [USC Theory Group](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/) and [Prof. Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io) of [Allegro Lab](https://allegro-lab.github.io) within [USC NLP Group](https://nlp.usc.edu), and I'm working closely with [Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~soltanol/index.html) and [Prof. Shang-Hua Teng](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~shanghua/).
