### About
I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, Viterbi School of Engineering at University of Southern California. Here is my [CV](/_docs/cv_2022.pdf). I'm in the [USC Thoery Group](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/) advised by [Prof. Vatsal Sharan](https://vatsalsharan.github.io), and meanwhile I'm working on building robust Natrual Language Processing advised by [Prof. Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io) of [USC NLP Group](https://cl.usc.edu). 

Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree in the Statistics at the University of Chicago and I was also an undergraduate student at the College, the University of Chicago, majoring in Mathematics (with Honors), Computer Science (with Honors) with the specialization in Machine Learning, and Statistics. 

I have a broad interest in machine learning and deep learning. My interested includes, but not limited to, deep learning theory, representation learning, topological data analysis, spectral methods, and deep generative models.

* Chinese History
  I'm especially interested in [Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Wei)-[Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(266–420))-[Northern and Southern dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_Southern_dynasties)  ([魏晋南北朝](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/魏晋南北朝)) period, which is an about 400-year transitional periods between Han ([汉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/汉朝)) and Tang（[唐](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/唐朝)). 魏晋南北朝 is a period of both military/political chaos and cultural prosperity.
