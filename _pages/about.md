### About
I'm a M.S. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. Here is my [CV](/_docs/cv.pdf). 

Before that, I was an undergraduate student at the College, the University of Chicago, majoring in Mathematics (with Honors), Computer Science (with Honors) with the specialization in Machine Learning, and Statistics. 

I have a broad interest in machine learning and deep learning. My interested includes, but not limited to, deep learning theory, representation learning, topological data analysis, spectral methods, and deep generative models.
